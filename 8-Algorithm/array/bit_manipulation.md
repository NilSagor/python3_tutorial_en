A binary system has only two states Logic "0" abd Logic "1" giving a base of 2
A decimal systems uses 10 different digits, 0 to 9 giving it a base of 10
A binary system is a weighted number who's weighted value increases from right to left
the weight of a binary digit doubles from right to left
a decimal number can be converted to a binary number by using the sum of weights method or the repeated division by 2 metod
when we convert numbers from binary to decimal or decimal to binary subscripts are used to avoid errors
when converting decimal number to binary numbers it is important to remember which is the least significat bit (LSB) and which is the most significant bit (MSB)


Any numbering system can be summerized as:

N = b subscripts(i) q superscript(i)

where 

N is a real positive number
b is the digit
q is the base value
integer i can be positive, negative or zero

N = b(i)q(i).....b3q3 + b2q2 + b1q1 + b0q0+b(-1)q(-1)+b(-2)q(-2)+... etc

Decimal Numbering System:

Each integer number column has values of units 10, 100, 1000 etc and move along the number from right to left.

Mathmatically the number written as 



Converting integer into binary

--- Start with the integer in question
--- Divide it by 2
--- Notice of the quotient and remainder
--- Conitnue dividing the quotient by 2 until get quotient of zero
--- then just write out the ramainders in the reverse order

	12 / 2 = 6 + 0
	6 / 2  = 3 + 0
	3 / 2  = 1 + 1
	1 / 2  = 0 + 1

12(10) ====> 1100(2)

Converting Decimal fraction into binary

--- Start with the fraction in question
--- Multyply by 2 until get a resulting fractional part to 0
--- then just write out the integer parts from the results of each multiplication
		
		0.375 x 2 = 0 + 0.75
		0.75 x 2 = 1 + 0.5
		0.5 x 2 = 1 + 0
		0. 375(10) ======> 0.011(2)


Converting binary integer to decimal

--- Start from the left
--- Take the current total
--- multiply it by 2 and add the current digit
--- Continue until there are no more digits left
