A binary system has only two states Logic "0" abd Logic "1" giving a base of 2
A decimal systems uses 10 different digits, 0 to 9 giving it a base of 10
A binary system is a weighted number who's weighted value increases from right to left
the weight of a binary digit doubles from right to left
a decimal number can be converted to a binary number by using the sum of weights method or the repeated division by 2 metod
when we convert numbers from binary to decimal or decimal to binary subscripts are used to avoid errors
when converting decimal number to binary numbers it is important to remember which is the least significat bit (LSB) and which is the most significant bit (MSB)


Any numbering system can be summerized as:

N = b subscripts(i) q superscript(i)

where 

N is a real positive number
b is the digit
q is the base value
integer i can be positive, negative or zero

N = b(i)q(i).....b3q3 + b2q2 + b1q1 + b0q0+b(-1)q(-1)+b(-2)q(-2)+... etc

Decimal Numbering System:

Each integer number column has values of units 10, 100, 1000 etc and move along the number from right to left.

Mathmatically the number written as
